First npm i on the root directory HW2 then npm i in the UI directory.

Then in root direction on vs code terminal. Write this command: nodemon server.js.
Then the second terminal is on vscode while the previous terminal is open. Then write that command to second: npm start.

There is no problem with the database. Because my database is on the cloud. If you want to indicate the Mongodb database. You should download Mongodb compass app. Then connect with that Url: mongodb+srv://yusufemre140:DXIRcSXuybixbpWz@cluster0.0dj0gv5.mongodb.net/. After that, you can see and manipulate every data.

In addition to that project, I added the clear cart button. If you want to delete cart items and debug again. You can clear the cart and continue.
