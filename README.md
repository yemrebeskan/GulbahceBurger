First npm i on root directory HW2 then npm i in UI directory.

Then in root direction on vscode terminal. Write this command: nodemon server.js.
Then the second terminal on vscode while previous terminal is open. Then write that command to second: npm start.

There is no problem for database. Because my database is on cloud. If you want to indicate mongodb database. You should download mongodb compass app. Then connect with that Url: mongodb+srv://yusufemre140:DXIRcSXuybixbpWz@cluster0.0dj0gv5.mongodb.net/. After that you can see and manipulate every data.

In addition to that project, I added the clear cart button. If you want to delete cart items and debug again. You can clear cart and continue.
